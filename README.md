# Bassline.io — Song Popularity Analysis
## Project Goal
Assess whether existing engineered audio features can meaningfully predict song popularity.
## Dataset & Features
- Numerical audio features (danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.)
- Target variable: song popularity
## Methodology
- EDA and correlation analysis
- Feature preprocessing
- Linear regression baseline
- Model evaluation (MSE, residuals)
## Findings
- Limited but consistent predictive signal
- Energy and danceability most informative
- Minimal overfitting observed
## Limitations & Risks
- Feature constraints
- Linear assumptions
- Missing external drivers
## Future Improvements
- Non-linear models
- Expanded feature engineering
- Genre and temporal segmentation
